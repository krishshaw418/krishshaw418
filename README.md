- ⚡ Fun fact:  The term "bug" in computer programming has a quirky origin. In 1947, computer scientist Grace Hopper found an actual moth causing a malfunction in the Harvard Mark II computer. She taped the insect into the computer's logbook with the note, "First actual case of bug being found." Since then, the term "debugging" became synonymous with the process of fixing errors in code, and the word "bug" stuck around in the programming world to describe any glitch or flaw in a program. So, the next time you encounter a bug in your code, just remember it might not be as small as a moth!
